# Vue3 Stores form test app

I wanted to test what's possible with simply a different kind of lead form. As the user steps through, they see their input data-bound to some messaging. I think this could be expanded to be dynamic messaging (gathering the weather data once they put in their zipcode say).

I'll say, this is my 4th iteration of the project. Rather than create a cool website with a form on it, this assignment to me was about what can you do with a form.

## Future Improvements
- I'd like to take advantage of Jamstack arcitecture to create the database saving feature.
- More dynamic messaging for the user as they step through.
- More interactive around the form.

## Tech Used
- Vue3
- Tailwindcss
- Netlify to host and deploy from github
